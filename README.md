- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JohnK239
- ðŸ‘€ I write iPhone iPad apps, many of them have something to do with music. 
- You can find the apps by searching for my company "eXQuisite software" or "eXQuisite thinking.
- Other apps I have coded for other organizations are:
- WORDSQUARES CROSSWORD PUZZLES (featured in the first (and only) season of Apple's PLANET OF THE APPS
- MediSounds For Sleep
- Cat Nap
